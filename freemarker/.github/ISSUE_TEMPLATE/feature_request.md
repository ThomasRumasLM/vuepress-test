## Description
<!-- A few sentences describing the overall goals of `merge request` -->

<!-- All socles have a main branch named `master` and no `develop` branch. Thus, you should checkout your branch from `master` and name it accordingly : `[feature / hotfix]_[feature_name / scope]_[label]` -->

<!-- Ex: `hotfix_custom-event-contructor-unavailable-in-ie` -->

Issue:
