## Why
Finding the closest parent who match a specific selector is a common functionality from jQuery.  
It can be tricky to replicate in vanilla, so we've done a helper for it

## Where
This method is available in the global object `lm`  
This object is defined by common.js file

To read the whole function in **lmfr-int-socle-js**,
