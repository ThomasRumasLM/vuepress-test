# Buttons

> **Buttons are used to initialize an action**. Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

**WARNING** : Mozaic buttons are available, so LMFR buttons are now considered legacy.

## Depreciated
> Long time support of former button classes will end on **10th may 2020**.
