# Links

> **Links** are used primarily as a navigational element. Links may also change what or how data is displayed (view more, show all etc.).<br >If the action taken by the user will change or manipulate data, use a [button](/Components/buttons).

**WARNING** : Mozaic buttons are available, so LMFR buttons are now considered legacy.
