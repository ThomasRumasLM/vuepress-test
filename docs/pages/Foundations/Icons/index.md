# Icons

You can use:

* [MOZAIC Icons](http://mozaic.adeo.cloud/Foundations/Icons/catalog/)

> This macro imports an icon from the Mozaic design system to the DOM.
These included SVGs have a class that attributes their format defined by the design system.  
These included SVGs use the tag `<use>` so as not to repeat the SVG DOM unnecessarily.
If the icon never has included inside the component, so,  a `<symbol>` will be included before the SVG tag.
