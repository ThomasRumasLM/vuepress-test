## Contributing Process

1. First, identify the features to develop
2. Second, create an issue to explain your intent, **following the Github template in english** (_If you want to make a fix, go to the 4th step_)
3. Third, the governor should read your issue in the following 24 hours and *accept the intent issue* (_If you need him, a pilot will be attributed to help you during the conception_)
4. After that, **if your issue is accepted**, you have to create a [**Draft Pull Request**](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) (It's like a `WIP` PR) and begin your development.<br > => **If it's not accepted**, you have to *develop your feature in your application*
5. **Important**: to close your issue when your PR will be merged, add this comment `Issue to resolve #[issue number]` ( _e.g issue to resolve #52_) on your PR
6. Once you have done that, **push your work regularly**, so we can follow the modifications, and please never forget: **commit message and code comments are in english**
7. When you are done, you should **squash your commits into one** and  click on the button "**Ready for review**" (see **Squash and rebase tutorial** section)
8. Now, your PR is ready for review and merge <br >**=>** After that, **you can not put your PR back into `draft` status**, so if you have not finished, you can also **add the "WIP" flag** to your PR.
9. To finish off, **the governor** should read it in the following **24 hours and *approuve the review*, *squash and merge* and *tag the release***.
