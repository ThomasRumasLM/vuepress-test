> Workflow to apply when you decide to develop a new feature into the git shared mono-repo

## 1 - Choose or submit a new subject

If you want to be part of a R&D development you have 2 solutions :
* Choose an available subject <Link text="here" blank=true href="https://github.com/adeo/integration-web-core--socle/labels/R%26D"></Link>
* Submit a new subject creating a issue <Link text="here" blank=true href="https://github.com/adeo/integration-web-core--socle/issues/new/choose"></Link>

### What's next

* **Draft issues will be challenge and validate** with lead front-end and Core team to write a final version 
* **Valid issues will be assigne weekly** at the Lead front-end meeting each Tuesday to differents persons
    * a front-end developer (maybe more if necessary)
    * a core team member who will be the pilot
    * a designer (if necessary)
* **Assigned issue will be transfered as a JIRA issue** in the <Link text="IWC project" blank=true href="https://archidevlm.atlassian.net/browse/IWC-309"></Link>

## 2 - Conception

Once the issue have been assigned and before starting development, you have to achieved some actions :
* **Meet the pilot and the designer** to define the specification and the goal of the project, valid or challenge sketches, propose motion or alternative
* **Propose a conception** clear, precise and efficient which have been validated with all the designated members (front-end, pilot and designer)
* **Do a time estimation** which you will need to achieved the development </br>
_This estimation allow the pilot to manage your availability in your feature team and plan as well as possible the development_

## 3 - Development and code review

**CONGRAT'S ! This is your first day of R&D development.**

> Come to the core team office, a seat is waiting for you. It's not mandatory but you will be sure to be 100% focus on your development and you will not be bothered by your feature team that you already miss

Don't forget that it's a better solution to work on an isolated kobi module.</br>
We propose you to work on the sandbox module.

## 4 - Code review

> As you are developping for everybody using kobi and the front-end mono-repo, you have to respect guidelines and good practices.

Code review can be done at the end of the project but we advice you to do it frequently with your core team pilot.
Of course you can do code review every day with every body if you want but don't forget that the last validator is your pilot. he have to look your code as often as possible to avoid you to re-write to much code while you thought you had finished your developments.

## 5 - UI/UX review

If you develop a new graphic feature, you have to organize, at least one but more might be necessary, a review with the designated designer.

We can choose to invit the core team pilot to discuss all together ;)
