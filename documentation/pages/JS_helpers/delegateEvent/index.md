# delegateEvent

## Why
Delegating js event with jquery was easy  
In vanilla js, it still can be done, but can be tricky to declare, and the event.target doesn't match with the element 
we want to listen

## Where
This method is available in the global object `lm`  
This object is defined by common.js file
