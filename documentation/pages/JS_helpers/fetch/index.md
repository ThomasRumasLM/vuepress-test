# fetch

## Why
We wanted to provide a tool to simplify the use of fetch and promises.
The method parameters are inspired by the jquery syntax to keep things familiar

## Where
This method is available in the global object `lm`  
This object is defined by common.js file  

To read the whole function in **lmfr-int-socle-js**,
