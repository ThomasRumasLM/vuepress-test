# Data attributes

### Write the good Freemarker macro 

We choose to make a 180Â° turn of how we write Freemarker's macro now. Please be respectful and follow this precipes. 

Now, we only write essentials things inside macro, it means that we will only write config hash for usefull properties to generate the component, other things that it's only needed in specific case like custom HTML class, special HTML data attributes... will be not write inside macro configuration hash, but like custom parameters. 

This is an example how you deal with that concept : 

`<#macro button configButton={} dataSup...>`

Each data that will be write that it's not declared as a know parameter. Will be inside a hash generated by Freemarker in `dataSup`. 

So after that to construct HTML data attributes, you can do it : 

```ftl
<#assign dataAttributes=""/>
<#if dataSup?is_hash>
    <#list dataSup as key, value>
        <#if key != 'class'>
            <#assign dataAttributes = dataAttributes + " ${key}=\"${value}\""/>
        </#if>
    </#list>
</#if>
```

Now you can pass your `dataAttributes` inside the good HTML tag you want to append it with a litteral string `${dataAttributes}`. 

If you want you can go on `buttons.ftl` to see how it work and have a real example.
