## Github Contributing Process

### Create a new feature:

> 💎 _Every projects **have to follow the git conventions**_  [available here](/Workflows/Git_conventions)

1️⃣ Identify the features to develop<br />
2️⃣ Create an issue to explain your intent, **following the Github template in english** <br />
3️⃣ The governor should read your issue in the following 24 hours and *accept the intent issue* <br />

> 👉 _If you need him, a pilot will be attributed to help you during the conception, don't hesitate to yell if you need help, Slack channels are here for that_<br />

4️⃣ After that, **if your issue is accepted**, you have to create a [**Draft Pull Request**](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) (It's like a `WIP` PR) and begin your development.<br />
> 👉 **If it's not accepted**, you have to *develop your feature in your application*<br />

5️⃣ Once you have done that, **push your work regularly**, so we can follow the modifications, and please never forget: **commit message and code comments are in english**<br />
6️⃣ When you are done, you should **squash your commits into one** and  click on the button "**Ready for review**" (see **Squash and rebase tutorial** section)<br />
7️⃣ Now, your PR is ready for review and merge <br />
> 👉 After that, **you can not put your PR back into `draft` status**, so if you have not finished, you can also **add the "WIP" flag** to your PR.

8️⃣ To finish, **the governor** should read it in the following **24 hours and *approuve the review*, *squash and merge* and *tag the release***.<br /><br />

### Create a fix:
> 👾 _Before create a branch of fix, you can create an issue_ [here](https://github.com/adeo/integration-web-core--socle/issues).

1️⃣ **Important**: to close your issue when your PR will be merged, add this comment `Issue to resolve #[issue number]` ( _e.g issue to resolve #52_) on your PR.<br />
