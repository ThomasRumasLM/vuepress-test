## File to import

To benefit the popin classes:

```scss
@import 'node_modules/integration-web-core--socle/css/assets/sass/_common/01-setting-tools/all-settings';
```

> **Note** You don't have to import the button atom file. It's already available in all Kobi page thanks to `common.css` which already imports it.
