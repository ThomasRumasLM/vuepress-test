# Pagination

> **Pagination** Pagination enables users to navigate from a page to another one, especially when a large content needs to be splitted in several parts. It's mainly used on pages like the search engine result page or the list pages.

**WARNING** : Mozaic pagination is available, so LMFR pagination are now considered legacy.
